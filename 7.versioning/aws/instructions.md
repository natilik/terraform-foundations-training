# Lab - Versioning

1. Navigate to the “7.versioning” directory and select the relevant cloud sub-directory.
    * Note: You’ll need to be on Windows for this lab to work as expected.

2. Your colleague has defined some Terraform resources that they want to create, but they didn’t check the documentation. The old provider version in use doesn’t have all the resources defined.

3. Fix the issues in the directory so that the resource successfully deploys. 
    * Do this without manually deleting any files.
    * Use a “pessimistic versioning” constraint for the version string.

4. Check the version of terraform you are running, then set a version constraint to a newer value – re-run the plan/apply process and note the error messages.
