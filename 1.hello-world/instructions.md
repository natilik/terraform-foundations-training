# Lab - Hello World

Time for a quick break from theory!

1. Clone the training repository that we will use throughout the rest of this course “git clone https://github.com/natilik/terraform-foundations-training.git”

2. Open the “1.hello-world” directory in your code editor of choice (VSCode recommended). You’ll have a single file called “main.tf” – have a look over it and see if you can understand what it will do.

3. Run through the commands required for the Terraform workflow reviewed earlier – init/plan/apply.
Hint: If using VSCode it has an integrated terminal “Terminal > New Terminal”.

4. Try changing some of the values in main.tf, save and re-run the relevant Terraform commands to see what happens. 

5. We will cover the configuration language in the next section – but feel free to have a play and get comfortable with the overall workflow.

6. If you want, have a look at some of the other resources available under the random provider - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs.
