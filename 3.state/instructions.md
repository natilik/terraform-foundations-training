# Lab - Importing 

1. Navigate to the “3.state” directory and select the AWS or Azure sub-directory. Be sure to change location in your terminal using the “cd” command.

2. There are three parts to this lab:
  * We are going to create some resources outside of Terraform (using scripts) so we can import them.
  * We are then going to move resources in state (i.e. renaming them), then try removing resources from state.
  * Finally, we will look at migrating our local state to a remote backend.

3. As we’ve some scripts to run, follow the cloud-specific instructions shown in the relevant folder:
  * AWS – See “aws/aws_instructions.md”.
  * Azure – See “azure/azure_instructions.md”.
